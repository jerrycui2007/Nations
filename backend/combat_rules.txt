1. There is no unit queue - a unit is randomly selected to make its attack, based off random weighted pick based on maneuver.
2. When a unit is chosen to attack, it will target a random unit from the opposing side, equally weighted.
3. The unit makes a base roll of random number between 1 to 100. 
4. Attacker's maneuver - defender's maneuver is added to this roll.
5. If a final roll is 90+, the attack is critical (1.5x damage multiplier), if it is 1-10, it is a graze (0.5x damage multiplier), and if it is lower than 0, it is a miss.
6. The base damage is the attacker's firepower * 10, and then decreased by the defender's armour * 5. A random number between -4 and 4 is added to the damage.
7. Any unit buffs are applied here (in the order of attacker buffs, defender buffs, attacker teammate buffs, defender teammate buffs).
8. The multiplier is applied to the damage. Damage can never be less than 1.
9. The defender's hp is decreased by the damage. If it goes to 0 or below, the unit is destroyed, and can no longer attack or be targeted.
